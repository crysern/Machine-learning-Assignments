# Assessed Assignment 1

Task 1
We're going to ask you take the trained model and write the code to make two metrics - Diversity and Novelty. You should end up with one statistic for each that tells you something about the recommendations of the trained model based on the whole dataset.

Task 2
Using a dimensionality reduction approach, plot the top 30 best rated films on a 2-D graph based on their movie embeddings. Label each point with the title.

# Assignment 2 : 

Problem Statment: How might we provide potential students visiting the UAL website more relevant/tailored course recommendations? (You do have the option to propose a different problem statement within the UAL website context and design for that).

Follow the design process to develop and propose a system/approach. You should utilise Patterns from People+AI Guide Book to guide your design and make it clear in your report how youâ€™ve incorporated them.

The submission will be in the form of a report ranging from 800-1000 words showcasing your unique approach. The submission should also include your problem statement, stakeholders, user persona (with their needs), and user journey to frame the context. Furthermore the report should include wireframes of this proposed approach clearly showcasing how it will work within the current website.
